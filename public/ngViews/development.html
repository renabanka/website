                    Green Dot's Knowledge Sharing Platform was inflexible, hard to
                    navigate, and required a lot maintenance from the IT and
                    Application teams. As the Technical Project Manager, I was tasked to vet applications that would meet our needs and fill these existing gaps. After 12 months of research, design, and build, my team and I launched a brand new Knowledge Sharing Platform on WordPress that incorporated a
                    sleek design, was mobile friendly, improved processes, and received universal buy in from our national organization.</p>

                    color schema and school logo.

                    My team and I created a unified look for all school websites while still meeting
                    the needs of each school. We also enabled the schools to update certain aspects (Google calendars, news and
                    announcements, staff directory) through plugins, eliminating the need to train each school on another tool and allowing us to create a centralized web admin position.</p>
